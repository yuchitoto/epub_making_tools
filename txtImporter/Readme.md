# txtImporter
This is a [Sigil](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil) plugin that is modified from [John Crew's TextImporter v0.1.0.5](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=285771).

This plugin changes the behaviour of John's such that only non-empty newlines will be tagged. This plugin also extends the behaviour such that the plugin will recognize some delimiters in the same paragraph and add related tags as specified in the rule book (please refer to [raw_text_to_html](https://github.com/yuchitoto/epub_making_tools/tree/master/raw_text_to_html))
